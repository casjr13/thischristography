# This Christography

This app was built using the `create-react-app` tool. The app is written using TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

## Development
To develop in this project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you are on the `source` branch
3. Install dependencies using `yarn`
4. Run the development instance by `yarn start`

## Production
To create a production build, run `yarn build`. To deploy the newly created production build, run `yarn deploy`.

Running a deployment will publish the `build` directory to the `master` branch. The `master` branch on the `casjr13` repository is where the site is hosted.
